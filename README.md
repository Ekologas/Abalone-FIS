"Fishery independent survey data of blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) populations in Victoria, Australia"

Fishery independent surveys in the Victorian Abalone Fishery have been conducted at fixed sites along the Victorian coastline since 1989/90. The number of survey sites has increased over time to a peak of 204 sites in 2004 but was subsequently decreased to 143 sites from 2017 onward. 
The surveys were designed to provide:

•	Trends in pre-recruit abundance

•	Trends in recruit abundance

•	Length frequency statistics

The precise co-ordinates and characteristics of each fixed site are fully described and have been photographed both above and below the waterline. Most are located close to shore in depths ranging from about 5 to 18 metres, but some are located outside this range in accordance with the specific reef topography. At each site, all abalone are counted within six belt transects, which are strips of bottom 30 m long by one metre wide radiating out from a fixed central point marked by a buoyed shot-line. The transects are randomly selected from 12 cardinal directions spaced at 30-degree arcs commencing with due north (0 degrees). Research divers count abalone into three categories: Juveniles, Pre-recruits and Recruits. Juveniles are defined as < 80 mm shell length or 40 mm less than the LML specified in the Fisheries Regulations 2009 (whichever is lower). Pre-recruits are abalone with shell lengths between the juveniles and the LML specified in the legislation (this is always a 40 mm size class). Recruits are abalone above the legislated LML (120mm west of Lorne and east of Lakes Entrance, 100mm within Port Phillip Bay, and 110mm elsewhere). Counting commences 5-m from the shot weight at the central point creating a circular site 70 m in diameter or 3850 m2 in area.

At the end of each transect 25 abalone are collected as far as possible without bias and brought aboard the boat where their shell lengths are measured to the nearest millimetre using an electronic measuring board which automatically logs the lengths along with date, time and GPS coordinates. As far as practicable, two research divers equally share the survey at each site to enable statistical comparison of diver performance.

These data are manually entered into MS Excel spreadsheets by VFA staff and checked in accordance with a SOP before transmission to the database manager for uploading.
